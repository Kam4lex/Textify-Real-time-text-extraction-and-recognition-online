A Python-based computer vision application is developed using Flask and OpenCV to accurately extract characters. This system efficiently processes a wide range of visual inputs, including photos, videos, and scanned documents, extracting 
text characters with high precision. The extracted text supports various applications such as text recognition. The application outlines the techniques and algorithms involved in character extraction, including image pre-processing, feature extraction, 
and classification. Image pre-processing enhances contrast and removes noise, while segmentation methods like thresholding and contour detection isolate individual characters. These characters are then classified using machine learning models and 
custom deep learning model. This Flask-based system was evaluated on a dataset of images with diverse fonts and sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness in precise character extraction and classification. The web interface provides an accessible and 
interactive platform for real-time character recognition, making it adaptable for a variety of practical uses.
